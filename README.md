# TinyML University Project

In this project are created different deep learning models (Convolutional Neural Network, Fully Connected network, LSTM) and are compared inference 
performance between different devices (ESP-32, Arduino, ESP-8266) and different model complexities.

Each neural network resolves a practical use case: room occpuncy detection, drowsiness detection, time series forecast.

* **file TinyMLperformanceEval.pdf**: report of the project;
* **folder python**: notebook e i dataset used for model creation and for data display;
* **folder device_code**: contains a folder for each problem considered (room occupancy detection, drowsiness detection, time series and quantization).
